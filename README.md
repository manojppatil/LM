# hello-world

Good morning...

I am Manoj Patil, I am 20 years old, I am from Kalyan and I have just finished my Bachelors in Computer Science. I enjoy team work, and I
am looking for my first job, ideally in a IT sector. I want to learn, and meet like-minded people in work. In my free time I like to write,
read books, and meet with friends.
